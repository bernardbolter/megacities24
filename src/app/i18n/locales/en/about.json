    "overviewEffectText" : "The overview effect is a cognitive shift reported by some astronauts while viewing the Earth from space. Researchers have characterized the effect as \"a state of awe with self-transcendent qualities, precipitated by a particularly striking visual stimulus\". The most prominent common aspects of personally experiencing the Earth from space are appreciation and perception of beauty, unexpected and even overwhelming emotion, and an increased sense of connection to other people and the Earth as a whole. The effect can cause changes in the observerâ€™s self concept and value system, and can be transformative.",
